# qa-f23
(Fall 2023) Codes and notebooks for quant analyst lectures. Presentations will be sent out via Slack after lecture.

### How to get started:

#### VSCode or Jupyter Notebooks
0) If you are not familiar with Git, please refer to this [repository](https://github.com/bualpha/learn-git) and/or other online resources to set up Git.
1) Fork this repository, so you can have a copy on your own GitHub (remote).
2) In your terminal app, go into your desired storage location by using `cd <your/desired/directory/>`, i.e. where would you like to store or download this repo?
3) Now, to get this **qa-f23** repository onto your local machine, type `git clone <your_repository_github_url>` into your terminal. You may use the URL on your browser or the URL under `<> Code` > `HTTPS` (prefered).
5) Use `cd qa-f23` to go into the **qa-f23** repo on your local machine and edit as desired.
6) To log your changes use `git add "<file.py>"` to stage your edits, and `git commit -m "<your commit message>"` to commit your edits to your local repository.
7) To push your changes from your local machine to your remote repository (your GitHub account), use `git push`.

*Note: Commands for Powershell (CMD) on Windows might be different from MacOS and Linux.*

#### GitHub Codespaces
0) If you are not familiar with Git, please refer to this [repository](https://github.com/bualpha/learn-git) and/or other online resources to set up Git.
1) Fork this repository, so you can have a copy on your own GitHub (remote).
2) In your forked repository, you can open up codespaces under `<> Code` > `Codespaces`.
3) Edit and commit and push as needed. It works just like VSCode.
